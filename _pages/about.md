**Microbial Genomics & Computational Pathogen Evolution**
**Our Mission**

The Bawn Lab applies cutting-edge computational and sequencing approaches to understand bacterial evolution, antimicrobial resistance, and microbial adaptation. We focus on how pathogens interact with their environment, hosts, and each other through horizontal gene transfer, helping to shape strategies for public health interventions and genomic surveillance.
Our Research

Our work is at the intersection of microbial genomics, evolutionary biology, and computational biology. We develop novel bioinformatics tools and single-cell sequencing approaches to study:

  - Pathogen Evolution & Population Genetics – Understanding how bacterial pathogens evolve, spread, and adapt to different environments.
  - Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) & Horizontal Gene Transfer – Investigating the genetic mechanisms behind the emergence of resistance and virulence factors in bacterial populations.
  - Single-Cell Genomics for Microbial Ecology – Using single-cell sequencing to study microbial communities, in-vitro evolution, and host-pathogen interactions.
  - AI & Data Science in Genomics – Developing computational frameworks for genomic analysis, with a focus on integrating AI-driven methods for pathogen surveillance and educational applications.

Who We Are

The lab is led by Dr. Matt Bawn, a Senior Lecturer in Microbial Genomics at Newcastle University. Dr. Bawn has a background in bioinformatics, bacterial evolution, and computational biology, with extensive experience in population genomics of foodborne and human pathogens. His interdisciplinary research spans biophysics, genomics, and AI-driven data science, focusing on microbial evolution and the development of computational methods for pathogen surveillance.

Dr. Bawn has held research positions at institutions including Quadram Institute, Earlham Institute, and the University of Leeds. He is an invited speaker at international conferences and contributes to public discussions on AI in education and bioinformatics. He also serves on multiple academic advisory panels, shaping research policy and mentoring the next generation of microbial genomics researchers.
